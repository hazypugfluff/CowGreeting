# Now with âœ¨ Plugins! âœ¨

Plugins are automatically stored in `~/.config/cowgreeting/plugins/` and the directory is created on first run.

ðŸ›  Installation

## 1. Debian Package Installation (Recommended)

Download the latest `.deb` package from the [Releases page](https://github.com/hazypugfluff/CowGreeting/releases) and install:

```bash
# Download and install the package
wget https://github.com/hazypugfluff/CowGreeting/releases/latest/download/cowgreeting_VERSION_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i cowgreeting_VERSION_all.deb

# If dependencies are missing, install them:
sudo apt-get install -f
```

The package automatically:
- âœ… Installs cowsay dependency
- âœ… Creates `cowgreeting` and `greetcow` commands
- âœ… Sets up plugin system
- âœ… Handles uninstallation cleanly

## 2. Manual Installation
Clone the repo and install the script:

git clone https://github.com/hazypugfluff/CowGreeting

cd greetcow

chmod +x greetcow.sh

sudo cp greetcow.sh /usr/local/bin/greetcow

Or place it anywhere in your PATH.

## 3. Configuration
CowGreeting looks for configuration files in two locations (in order of priority):
1. `~/.config/cowgreeting/greetcow.conf` (recommended)
2. Same directory as the script (legacy)

Here's an example config:
# .greetcow.conf

date_format=%Y-%m-%d

time_format=%H:%M

show_time=true

time_12hr=false

timezone=local

If no config is found, it will use sensible defaults.
